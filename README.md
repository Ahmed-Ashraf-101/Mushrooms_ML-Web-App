# Mushrooms_ML-Web-App
Deploying 3 classifiers on mushrooms edibility using Streamlit.

In this project, I have build 3 classification models: Logistic Regression model, Support Vector classifier and Random Forest algorithm to classify whether or not the mushrooms are edible or poisonous.

Streamlit for web application development.
Pandas & Numpy for manipulation.
Matplotlib for visualization.
Scikit-learn for preprocessing, evaluation and modelling.
